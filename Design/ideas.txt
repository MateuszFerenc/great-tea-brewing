# Features to implement list
# Fill box '[]' with proper option
# [âœ“] - done, [i] - in progress, [-] - won't do, [d] - discussion needed
[d] - implement realtime simulation
[d] - implement fast simulation, i.e. run simulation as fast as possible with given parameters and output data, and compute how much time it could took in real time
[] - simulation controls in main frame (schematic frame)
[] - implement step operation of the simulation
[i] - change tabs layout and appearance (move to center, change style)
